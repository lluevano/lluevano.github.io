title: "Effectiveness of Blind Face Restoration to Boost Face Recognition Performance at Low-Resolution Images"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-10-03-Effectiveness-Blind-Face-Restoration-FR
excerpt: "This paper studies the effectiveness of Blind Face Restoration methods to boost the performance of face recognition systems on low-resolution images. We investigate the use of three blind face restoration techniques, which have demonstrated impressive results in generating realistic high-resolution face images. Three state-of-the-art face recognition methods were selected to assess the impact of using the generated high-resolution images on their performance. Our analysis includes both, synthesized and native low-resolution images. The conducted experimental evaluation show that this is still an open research problem."
