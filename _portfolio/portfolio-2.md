This repository includes a forked base code for Face Anti-Spoofing using Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks with modifications for updating the code to newer Python version support and adding custom networks, evaluation code, and visualization options. We employed this code for one published paper at the Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop at CVPR 2023.
