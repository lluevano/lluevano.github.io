Researcher focused in Computer Vision, Biometrics, Privacy, and Decentralized Machine Learning. I am currently working as a Postdoctal Researcher at the Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland. Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the WIDE Team at Inria in the University of Rennes. My current research interests are Face Recognition, Face Anti-Spoofing, Privacy, and Decentralized Machine Learning. My PhD thesis work was on Binarized Neural Networks for Very Low Resolution Face Recognition for deployment on embedded devices.
